    <h1>My Trip to Japan</h1>
    <p>From mid-July to late-August of 2019, I completed a study-abroad program that took place in Japan. While I was there, I worked on my capstone project: studying the history of graffiti in Japan and how it influenced the development of the video game Jet Set Radio. Here are some photos I took while I was there.</p>

      <img src="images/genbaku_dome.jpg" data-title="Genbaku Dome" data-description="During the next week, we went to Hiroshima. While we were there, we were able to go to the Hiroshima Peace Museum, where the first bomb was dropped. This image is of the Genbaku Dome, which was very close to the impact site.">

      <img src="images/itsukushima_shrine.jpg"  data-title="Itsukushima Shrine" data-description="This picture is of the 'floating' Torii gate located at Itsukushima island. Other than the Himeji Castle, this is one of the most recognizable landmarks of Japan.">
