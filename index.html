    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Hometown</h2>
    <p>I went to high school around the Ann Arbor area, but I lived in Plymouth. Plymouth is a pretty low-key, quiet town when compared to its Massachusetts counterpart. The downtown area is where you can find things like Kellogg park, named after John Harvey Kellogg (yes, the cereal guy). If you're ever around the area, try and stop by the Plymouth Ice Festival, Art In The Park, or one of the concerts that seems to happen every few weeks.</p>

    <h2>High School</h2>
    <p>I went to high school at Greenhills School, located in Ann Arbor. While I was there, I was editor for the school newspaper, and helped with the technical production of lots of plays. Even though the school was a few minutes out from downtown, it was always within driving distance, and me and my friends would sometimes drive there after school to hang out. I grew up with the University of Michigan practically in my backyard, so at the time it seemed like an obvious choice to attend after high school. However, I wanted to make my own path, so I decided to go to school out of state. That's how I ended up at Illinois Tech.</p>
